# Courses from my education at Software University

## Programming Basics with C# 
Equips students with essential programming skills, foundational for all tech specialties at **SoftUni**.
Key topics include basic coding, using an IDE, working with variables, data types, operators, console input/output, conditional statements (if, if-else), and loops (for, while).

## C# Fundamentals
The next step in the **SoftUni** program, building on the concepts learned in Programming Basics. 
It covers more advanced programming topics, including data structures like arrays, lists, and dictionaries, and introduces the fundamentals of OOP with objects and classes. 
The course dives deeper into string manipulation and regular expressions, while also introducing version control with Git and essential web development technologies such as **HTML**, **CSS**, and **HTTP**.
